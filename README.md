# Appendix A documents

Appendix A documents for data sets. The content and purpose of these templates are
discussed in the [general NanoSolveIT DMP](https://github.com/NanoSolveIT/dmp/blob/rebrand/NanoSolveIT/DMP.md).

Basically, each data sets needs to have clear copyright and license information and
this Appendix A describes the three key pieces of information:

1. Who are the copyright owners (names)?
2. Under what conditions will the data be available to the consortium?
3. Under what conditions will the data be available to the rest of the world?

For practical purposes, the names are sufficient and email addresses do not
need sharing in this repository.
